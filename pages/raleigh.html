                    <em>In this guest post, Craig Makepeace (co-founder and publisher of ThisIsRaleigh.com) shares how
                        to
                        spend 24 hours in Raleigh, North Carolina.</em>

                    <p> I have called Raleigh, North Carolina, home for over 10 years. As one of the South’s most
                        vibrant
                        and eclectic burgs, this state capital might be one of the fastest-growing midsize cities in the
                        US.
                        It regularly tops the “best places to live and work in the US,” but it still offers small-town
                        charm
                        and Southern hospitality. My wife and I decided to raise our kids here because of this mix.</p>

                    <p>Nicknamed “the City of Oaks” for the sheer number of majestic oak trees that line the streets,
                        besides offering ample green spaces and trails, Raleigh is home to excellent museums, a thriving
                        restaurant scene, endless craft breweries, fun festivals and events, and college-town vibes!</p>
                    <p>Many visitors stop in Raleigh as part of a road trip or for work and thus don’t always have a lot
                        of
                        time to fully explore it. However, even if you just have one day, you can still see a lot.</p>
                    <p>Below is my personal guide to the best things to do in one day.</p>
                    <h3>Breakfast: Big Ed’s City Market</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/24hoursraleigh1.jpg" width="675" height="395">
                    <p>There’s no better Southern breakfast and introduction to Raleigh than at Big Ed’s in historic
                        City
                        Market, serving generous portions of Southern comfort food since 1958.
                        Here you’ll enjoy a laid-back vibe under a collection of funky antiques hanging from the
                        ceiling,
                        along with warm Southern hospitality and food like Grandma used to make. Especially popular are
                        their giant pancakes, local country ham, fried chicken, aged rib-eye steak and eggs, sliced pork
                        loin, fried catfish, fluffy biscuits, and double-brewed sweet tea. This is the local experience
                        you’re looking for.

                    </p>
                    <p>Alternate breakfast options include The Mecca, Raleigh’s oldest restaurant, founded by Greek
                        immigrants in 1930; and the State Farmers’ Market Restaurant, another popular place for locals
                        to
                        get a country breakfast and Southern dining experience!</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Morning activity: Museums</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/24hoursraleigh2.jpg" width="675" height="395">
                    <p>After filling up on a hearty meal, take in a museum. Raleigh has some excellent ones, and because
                        of
                        the quality and number of free museums it has, the city has often been referred to as “the
                        Smithsonian of the South.”
                        The fantastic Museum of Natural Sciences is North Carolina’s most visited museum. There are over
                        four floors of exhibits to explore, including live animals, walk-through dioramas, microbes,
                        meteorites, and 3D movies, plus a terrific permanent collection of dinosaur and whale skeletons.

                        If history is your thing, across the street is the North Carolina Museum of History. Founded in
                        1902, it welcomes more than 400,000 visitors a year to see its 150,000 artifacts from over
                        14,000
                        years of history.

                        Art lovers should head to the free North Carolina Museum of Art, home to more than a dozen
                        beautiful
                        gallery spaces showcasing art from around the world. You can explore on your own, take an
                        engaging
                        tour, or see some performing arts. Don’t miss taking a stroll through the 164-acre Ann and Jim
                        Goodnight Museum Park, whose trail system through natural areas features more than a dozen
                        commissioned works of art.</p>

                    <h3>Lunch: The Pit Authentic BBQ</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/24hoursraleigh3.jpg" width="675" height="395">
                    <p>North Carolina is a big barbecue state, and enjoying a plate is something they take very
                        seriously in
                        the state capital. It’s one of those “welcome to the South” moments all meat eaters should
                        experience.

                        In Raleigh, they mainly do Eastern-style barbecue, in which the whole hog is slow-cooked over
                        hot
                        coals; the meat is then pulled, given a little chop, and dressed with a vinegar-based sauce.
                        Typically, it’s served as a sandwich or a plated dish, with all the traditional Southern sides
                        you
                        can handle.</p>
                    <p>The Pit Authentic BBQ is one of the most popular such spots in Raleigh. As the name suggests, it
                        proudly serves authentic whole-hog, pit-cooked, Eastern-style barbecue. Located in the Warehouse
                        District, it’s well known for baby back ribs and whole-hog chopped barbecue. And for sides,
                        check
                        out the Brunswick stew, heirloom cabbage collards, and fried green tomatoes.

                        Famous in NC, Sam Jones BBQ in downtown is another excellent option. It smokes whole hogs
                        on-site
                        every day and is popular for its chopped barbecue, fried chicken, ribs, and baked flat
                        cornbread. It
                        also serves one of my favorite sandwiches in Raleigh, the smoked turkey!

                        If pork barbecue is not your thing but you still want a Southern dining experience, Beasley’s
                        Chicken + Honey is a popular lunch restaurant by famed chef Ashley Christensen that specializes
                        in
                        fried chicken and sandwiches.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Afternoon activity: Umstead State Park</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2024/24hoursraleigh4.jpg" width="675" height="395">
                    <p>Time to walk off lunch! Just a 15-minute drive from downtown is one of the most popular
                        destinations
                        in Raleigh, and one of North Carolina’s most visited state parks: William B. Umstead State Park,
                        which is easily accessible from Interstate 40 and US-70. Its more than 5,000 acres of forest
                        surround three man-made lakes and contain over 22 miles of trails, ranging from easy to
                        moderate. If
                        you love nature trails, biking, running, picnicking, canoeing, or even horseback riding, put
                        Umstead
                        on your itinerary.</p>
                    <p>A great introductory trail is the 2.8-mile Sal’s Branch Trail loop, which is mostly shaded and
                        flat, with tall trees and a lake view. If you’re up for a woodland walk, the Sycamore Trail is a
                        7.2-mile loop and the longest trail. Another popular trail is the six-mile Company Mill Trail
                        loop.</p>
