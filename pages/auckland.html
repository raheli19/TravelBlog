                    <p><strong>Posted: </strong>12/19/23 | December 19th, 2023</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Nicknamed “The City of Sails” for its waterfront location and seafaring history, Auckland boasts
                        scenic seaside views and ample water activities. New Zealand’s largest city (though contrary to
                        popular belief, it’s not the capital), Auckland is home to almost 35% of the country’s
                        population.</p>

                    <p>The largest airport is also located here, so if you
                        plan on traveling around <span class="span_blue">New Zealand</span> , you’ll probably be
                        starting your trip here. In addition to
                        all the water attractions, there’s an incredible food scene and insightful museums, as well as
                        vibrant neighborhoods with verdant parks, third-wave coffee spots, and very welcoming locals.
                    </p>

                    <p>To help you plan your visit, here’s my list of the best hotels in Auckland:</p>

                    <h3>1. The Albion</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/albionhotel.jpg">
                    <p>Built in 1873, the Albion is a lovely, warm spot in Central, the heart of everything in Auckland.
                        This hotel began as a “pub hotel,” meaning you could booze away downstairs before retiring in
                        adjoining rooms. Today, there’s still a nice tavern in the hotel, with a working fireplace and
                        billiards table. While it’s not open for breakfast, the restaurant does serve tasty pub food in
                        the evenings. Rooms here are simple, but decently sized for such a central location. All rooms
                        have very comfortable beds and pillows, great shower pressure, TVs, in-room tea and coffee. It’s
                        an excellent value for the area.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>2. Carnmore Takapuna</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/carnmoretakapuna.jpg">
                    <p>Located on Auckland’s North Shore, this area is famed for its beaches, yet it’s still only 20
                        minutes (by public transportation) from the center of town. The hotel has a minimalist beachy
                        aesthetic as well as free parking, a sauna, an outdoor pool, and a gym. Rooms are spacious and
                        filled with natural light thanks to the impressive floor-to-ceiling windows. Some rooms even
                        have balconies and jacuzzi baths (though even the bathrooms in standard rooms are giant). All
                        rooms have a flat-screen TV, desk, fridge, electric tea kettle, and free Wi-Fi. While there’s no
                        breakfast available at the property, you’re just steps away from the main street with several
                        quaint cafes. As an added bonus, the beach is only a five-minute walk away. </p>
                    <br>

                    <h3>3. Ascotia Off Queen</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/ascotiaoffqueen.jpg">
                    <p>Located in Karangahape Road (also known as K-Road), this is a good area if you want a
                        non-touristy neighborhood that’s relatively close to downtown. This property has a simple design
                        with pleasant earth tones. The amply sized rooms have a lot of natural light and come with a
                        flat screen TV, fridge, and a tea/coffee maker. There are two-bedroom apartments for families or
                        those traveling in groups too. There’s a complimentary continental breakfast, or you can upgrade
                        to a hot breakfast buffet. Overall, I think it’s an excellent value for the location.</p>
                    <h3>4. Park Hyatt Auckland</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/parkhyattauckland.jpg">
                    <p>Located in Britomart (named for the first British ship to navigate the harbor), this
                        sophisticated five-star hotel is one of the poshest properties in the entire city. Here you’ll
                        find several pools (including an impressive heated outdoor infinity pool), a sauna, hot tub,
                        steam room, and a 24-hour fitness center. There are multiple restaurants on site too, one of
                        which serves an excellent breakfast. Park Hyatt boasts spacious guest rooms that have
                        floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the harbor and some even have balconies. All of the
                        rooms have marble bathrooms and are equipped with a plus-sized flat-screen TV, a desk, plush
                        robes, and Le Labo bath products. If you want to stay close to the water (and you have the
                        budget for luxury), stay here.</p>
