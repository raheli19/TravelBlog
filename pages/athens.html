                <p><strong>Posted: </strong>12/19/23 | December 19th, 2023</p>
                <br>
                <p>This 5,000-year-old Greek capital is home to the iconic Acropolis with its hilltop of millennia-old
                    structures and ruins, and just below it, the Plaka neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets lined with
                    bars,
                    restaurants, and ancient ruins.</p>

                <p> While <span class="span_blue">Athens</span> has never spoken to me the way that other European
                    capitals
                    have (I’m more a fan of the islands and the interior of the country), it has grown on me on each
                    visit.
                    You can’t deny the layers of history here. You’ll stumble across millennia-old ruins as you stroll
                    down
                    random streets (this is why I love taking <span class="span_blue">walking tours in the city</span>
                    as
                    I’ll learn a ton about what I’m actually looking at).</p>

                <p>Picking the right hotel for your trip is very important as it’s a fairly sprawling city with a lot of
                    different neighborhoods to choose from.</p>
                <p>To help you choose, here’s my list of the best hotels in Athens:</p>
                <h3>1. Athens Center Square Hotel</h3>
                <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/athenscentersqhotel.jpg">
                <p>True to its name, this hotel is in Plaka, the historic central neighborhood. Despite the crowds, I
                    love this beautiful area. This hotel has a minimalist design with welcoming pastel colors
                    throughout, and most rooms have a view of the Acropolis (so be sure to ask for one). Plus, there’s a
                    rooftop terrace and bar with good views too. Rooms are simple but decently sized, with flat-screen
                    TVs, desks, mini fridges, air conditioning. The delicious buffet breakfast is complimentary and
                    quite expansive, featuring Greek and American cuisine. There’s also free coffee and tea in the lobby
                    all day long.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>2. Athensdot</h3>
                <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/athensredhotel.jpg">
                <p>This newer property is in Psyrri (sometimes spelled Psiri), a neighborhood that’s close to the main
                    sights yet much more frequented by locals. It’s my favorite area of the city. Athensdot has a cool,
                    pop-art design throughout, with large scale drawings on the walls and bright bursts of red
                    everywhere. Rooms vary from internal rooms with no window to rooms with a balcony and views of the
                    Acropolis. In all rooms you’ll find free Wi-Fi, large flat-screen TVs, mini fridges, and desks.
                    There’s friendly staff and you can also get free bikes to ride around too! While there’s no
                    breakfast served at the property, there’s a cute 24-hour café just a few doors down that serves food
                    at all hours. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>3. Dryades & Orion Hotel</h3>
                <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/dryadesandorionhotel.jpg" >
                <p>This cozy hotel is in Exarcheia, an area with a highly energetic student vibe and lots of street art.
                    This affordable hotel has lot of different room configurations to choose from and exceptionally
                    helpful staff. The sizable rooms have unique homey décor and eclectic furniture, plus all the normal
                    mid-range hotel amenities (air conditioning, tea/coffee makers, mini fridges). It’s worth it to pay
                    a bit extra for the homecooked breakfast buffet. It features local cuisine and is served on the
                    rooftop garden, which has great view of the Acropolis.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>4. Coco-Mat Hotel</h3>
                <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/cocomatathens.jpg">
                <p>This design-forward 4-star hotel is in the heart of Kolonaki, a quiet neighborhood renowned for its
                    upscale boutiques and art galleries. The hotel is actually run by the mattress company Coco-Mat. All
                    rooms are equipped with high-quality mattresses, and you can even choose your pillow from a menu
                    with 12 different pillow types. The entire hotel has a light and airy design, with wooden accents
                    and a soft color palate. Each room has a TV, free and fast Wi-Fi, a Nespresso machine, desk, loads
                    of natural light, and upscale bath products in the large bathrooms. There’s a fantastic Greek
                    breakfast buffet in the mornings too.</p>
