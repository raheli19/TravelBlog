                    <p><strong>Posted: </strong>12/19/23 | December 19th, 2023</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This 5,000-year-old Greek capital is home to the iconic Acropolis with its hilltop of
                        millennia-old
                        structures and ruins, and just below it, the Plaka neighborhood, a labyrinth of streets lined
                        with
                        bars,
                        restaurants, and ancient ruins.</p>

                    <p> While <a class="span_blue" href="#athenHotel">Athens</a> has never spoken to me the way that other European
                        capitals
                        have (I’m more a fan of the islands and the interior of the country), it has grown on me on each
                        visit.
                        You can’t deny the layers of history here. You’ll stumble across millennia-old ruins as you
                        stroll
                        down
                        random streets (this is why I love taking <span class="span_blue">walking tours in the
                            city</span>
                        as
                        I’ll learn a ton about what I’m actually looking at).</p>

                    <p>Picking the right hotel for your trip is very important as it’s a fairly sprawling city with a
                        lot of
                        different neighborhoods to choose from.</p>
                    <p>To help you choose, here’s my list of the best hotels in Athens:</p>
                    <h3>1. Coco-Mat Hotel</h3>
                    <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                        <source src="../assets/athensHotel.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                        Your navigator cannot support video mp4
                    </video>
                    <p>This design-forward 4-star hotel is in the heart of Kolonaki, a quiet neighborhood renowned for
                        its
                        upscale boutiques and art galleries. The hotel is actually run by the mattress company Coco-Mat.
                        All
                        rooms are equipped with high-quality mattresses, and you can even choose your pillow from a menu
                        with 12 different pillow types. The entire hotel has a light and airy design, with wooden
                        accents
                        and a soft color palate. Each room has a TV, free and fast Wi-Fi, a Nespresso machine, desk,
                        loads
                        of natural light, and upscale bath products in the large bathrooms. There’s a fantastic Greek
                        breakfast buffet in the mornings too.</p>
                    <h3 id="athenHotel">2. Athens Center Square Hotel</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/athenscentersqhotel.jpg">
                    <p>True to its name, this hotel is in Plaka, the historic central neighborhood. Despite the crowds,
                        I
                        love this beautiful area. This hotel has a minimalist design with welcoming pastel colors
                        throughout, and most rooms have a view of the Acropolis (so be sure to ask for one). Plus,
                        there’s a
                        rooftop terrace and bar with good views too. Rooms are simple but decently sized, with
                        flat-screen
                        TVs, desks, mini fridges, air conditioning. The delicious buffet breakfast is complimentary and
                        quite expansive, featuring Greek and American cuisine. There’s also free coffee and tea in the
                        lobby
                        all day long.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>3. Athensdot</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/athensredhotel.jpg">
                    <p>This newer property is in Psyrri (sometimes spelled Psiri), a neighborhood that’s close to the
                        main
                        sights yet much more frequented by locals. It’s my favorite area of the city. Athensdot has a
                        cool,
                        pop-art design throughout, with large scale drawings on the walls and bright bursts of red
                        everywhere. Rooms vary from internal rooms with no window to rooms with a balcony and views of
                        the
                        Acropolis. In all rooms you’ll find free Wi-Fi, large flat-screen TVs, mini fridges, and desks.
                        There’s friendly staff and you can also get free bikes to ride around too! While there’s no
                        breakfast served at the property, there’s a cute 24-hour café just a few doors down that serves
                        food
                        at all hours. </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>4. Dryades & Orion Hotel</h3>
                    <img src="https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2023/dryadesandorionhotel.jpg">
                    <p>This cozy hotel is in Exarcheia, an area with a highly energetic student vibe and lots of street
                        art.
                        This affordable hotel has lot of different room configurations to choose from and exceptionally
                        helpful staff. The sizable rooms have unique homey décor and eclectic furniture, plus all the
                        normal
                        mid-range hotel amenities (air conditioning, tea/coffee makers, mini fridges). It’s worth it to
                        pay
                        a bit extra for the homecooked breakfast buffet. It features local cuisine and is served on the
                        rooftop garden, which has great view of the Acropolis.</p>
